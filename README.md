ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @salmantella

You Progress the Nation follows... ðŸ“ˆðŸ“ˆðŸ“ˆ

I am Salman Tella, an experienced and versatile full-stack .NET developer with a strong background in C#, ASP.NET MVC, Web API, and SQL Server. With over 2 years of experience in developing high-quality, scalable web applications, I have a proven track record of delivering successful client features and dealing with Production Incidents.

In addition to my technical expertise, I also have a background in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, enabling me to build applications that are not only functional, but also visually appealing and user-friendly.

But what really sets me apart is my exceptional people and managerial skills. I am equally comfortable working independently or as part of a team, and my positive attitude and strong work ethic make me a valuable addition to any project.
